<h2>TO THE QUEEN DOWAGER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Madam,</span></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; When I first requested permission to dedicate this
humble effort to your Majesty, I felt&mdash;a feeling I confess which I had
no right to indulge&mdash;that I should be much disappointed if you were
pleased to refuse me; but now that you have graciously condescended
to honour me by granting it, a fear of the unworthiness of my offering
diminishes the gratification I should otherwise experience, and makes
me almost envious of talents which might better have justified your
patronage. Let others, however, excel me as much as they may in
those endowments which are supposed to constitute genius, I have at
least the comfort of reflecting that none can excel me in dutiful affection
to your Royal Person, in profound reverence for your character, and
in respectful admiration of those virtues which have long endeared you
to all British hearts, and will remain a monument of your goodness
when you shall have exchanged time for eternity.</p>

<p>More than this I dare not say, lest it should be imputed to a want of
delicacy: less than this I will not say, certain that it would be considered
as an omission of duty.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">I remain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">With the highest respect,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Madam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Your Majesty's most dutiful, most humble,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">And most devoted Servant,</span></p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In laying this Play before the public some apology is perhaps
due. Sensible that it cannot compete with many of the productions
of the present day, the author yet pleads for such exemption
only from severe criticism, as true humility, and a respect
for the opinions of an enlightened and intellectual age, may entitle
her to. She has not aimed at any display of originality, nor
has she been deceived by a presumptuous estimation of her
powers, to attempt that which she may not have more ability
than leisure and opportunity to accomplish. Unlike those who
write for amusement, or by profession, or in the consciousness of
their talents, to gain for themselves competence or fame, her pen
is exercised only to soothe anxiety, to refresh exhausted energy,
and to vary the monotony of seclusion. She would not, however,
be thought indifferent to the praise or censure of her contemporaries.
Far from it. No exertion, compatible with higher
duties, would be thought too severe to obtain the former, nor any
degree of patient labour too lengthened to avoid the latter. She
is, however, so circumstanced as to preclude such a dedication of
her time, and therefore is it that she ventures to ask for that indulgence
which, in another case, she would have deemed it unjustifiable
to claim or to expect.</p>

<p>But whilst all attempt at originality is disclaimed, imitation of
any one, or assistance from any one is equally disavowed. This
play was written before the late productions, which bear the
same title, made their appearance. Its defects therefore are its
own; its merits&mdash;if happily it possess any&mdash;are its own also;
and standing thus entirely upon its native ground, it is respectfully
submitted to the judgment of the public.</p>

<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Chinon.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alen&ccedil;on. Xaintrailles.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen&ccedil;on.</span>                     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Welcome again to freedom!</span><br />
France may rejoice, since thou in arms once more<br />
Art seen for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>            <span style="margin-left: 3em;">In arms to little purpose.</span><br />
Our cause is lost, my lord. Orleans, our best,<br />
Last hope, must fall, and shortly. But I have sought thee,<br />
Eager to know, to learn,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">What wouldst thou know?</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> This strange report! this damsel, who, 'tis said,<br />
Is hither come to work such wondrous feats&mdash;<br />
Whence doth she spring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">From Domremie; her birth</span><br />
Not less obscure than this her native village.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> How introduced?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">She first besought from Baudricour</span><br />
An escort to the Dauphin; but in vain.<br />
At length, her suit oft urged, fair character,<br />
And lofty words prevailed with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>                              <span style="margin-left: 9em;">The prince</span><br />
Will ne'er demean himself to listen to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span> A drowning man will catch, and eagerly,<br />
At weeds uprooted by the storm that wrecked him.<br />
She comes to-day, by order from himself,<br />
Before the council.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>              <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hast seen her?</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                              <span style="margin-left: 9em;">I have.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> Describe her: is she young?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                              <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Of that sweet age</span><br />
When girlish smiles assume the dignity<br />
Which conscious womanhood doth first confer:<br />
The rose just blushing to the full.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>                              <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Rustic,</span><br />
No doubt, and ignorant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Her soul hath stamped her manner</span><br />
Simple, yet dignified&mdash;lofty, yet meek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> Ta'en captive&mdash;grown poetic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                               <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Age like mine</span><br />
Has little thought of love or poesy;<br />
But yet there is a charm where loveliness<br />
Meets virtue, which it were a shame to slight.<br />
The snow which crowns the old man's head should make<br />
His reason cool, yet need not chill his heart.<br />
But come&mdash;the council must be now assembled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> One question more&mdash;is Richemont here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                                        <span style="margin-left: 15em;">Not he,</span><br />
Nor e'en desired. The hate the Dauphin bears him<br />
Continues undiminished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>                  <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Yet the world</span><br />
Believes them cordial friends; that with the rank<br />
He craved, the constable of France has lost<br />
All that disgust the Earl of Richemont felt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span> Charles never will forgive the insult shown<br />
To them he valued most. Du Ch&acirc;tel first,<br />
Then Louvel he required should be dismissed<br />
His service and the council&mdash;price of friendship.<br />
The first his interest in his master's sank,<br />
But Louvel's firm adherence to his post,<br />
Bringing Camouse's death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>                    <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Camouse's death!</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span> Ay, 'twas a bloody deed: but more anon,<br />
This maid absorbs all thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>                         <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Let's hasten then:</span><br />
My curiosity is all awake&mdash;<br />
And more, I bear an answer from the regent,<br />
Which to the prince and council I must show.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Cha.</span> We'll hear no more. Whilst one poor hope remained<br />
We would have hazarded our chance; but now<br />
Tis madness to resist.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Xaintrailles</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Alen&ccedil;on</span>.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Returned! How met</span><br />
The haughty occupant of our own place<br />
The offer tendered him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>                  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">As one who holds</span><br />
The game already in his hands may hear<br />
His adversary's scheme to share the stake.<br />
"I am not one," he said, "to beat the bush<br />
That others may secure the birds. Ere Orleans<br />
Can be sequestered, we must see good title<br />
To execute the deed; Bedford, not Burgundy,<br />
Must hold that city for his liege and lord."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span> Fool that we were to court such insolence!<br />
But yet perhaps 'tis only what ourselves<br />
Had, in like circumstances, said more rudely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span> Will not your grace resent the indignity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span> But how? words are but poor revenge;<br />
And words are all we boast. We will retire<br />
To Dauphin&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Omnes.</span>       <span style="margin-left: 2em;">To Dauphin&eacute;!</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span>                     <span style="margin-left: 8em;">You jest.</span><br />
You cannot mean&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span>             <span style="margin-left: 5em;">We've said, and mean it too.</span><br />
Fear not, my friends, we'll lead a joyous life.<br />
War we will have, as dappled deer shall find,<br />
A court midst sylvan shades, not lacking beauty,<br />
Though of but rural kind, to cheer our toils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span> (<i>aside.</i> Will nought correct this levity of speech?<br />
Xaintrailles himself, though not a whit more staid,<br />
Is by his thoughtless master shamed to gravity.)<br />
Your grace forgets the maid from Domremie<br />
Doth wait an audience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span>                   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">We much regret,</span><br />
My lord, our weak compliance with such folly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span> The royal word is pledged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span>                             <span style="margin-left: 11em;">We'll not retract it.</span><br />
It may at least afford us novelty.<br />
Let her appear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>          <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why not devise some plan</span><br />
To prove her truth, or to detect the fraud?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span> Well thought&mdash;but how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>                      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">To thee she bears this message.</span><br />
If Heaven, as she asserts, has sent her hither,<br />
He will not fail, by certain proof, to mark<br />
The mission his. Amongst ourselves then mingle,<br />
And let another represent thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span>                            <span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Good.</span><br />
No better representative than thou;<br />
In truth we do but play the part of king,<br />
And thou as aptly as ourself may act it.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> Thou hast an audience asked: thy suit thus granted,<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span>  I seek the royal ear: this is my prince!<br />
And thus with veneration deep&mdash;</p>

<p class="ralign">[<i>Kneels to Charles.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span>                           <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Not so.</span><br />
No female at my feet may kneel thus lowly.<br />
Maiden! I own no earthly state which claims<br />
Such reverence; but simply as a man<br />
I stand midst men, protector of thy sex,<br />
Admirer of thy charms!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span>                  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Just is the homage&mdash;</span><br />
But now (<i>rises</i>) I stand the delegate of heav'n,<br />
And thus declare my mission. "Go!" said the Mighty,<br />
"Go! tell thy prince deliverance is nigh:<br />
And thine the hand to rid him of his foes!<br />
Thou shalt raise the siege of Orleans!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span>                                    <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Indeed!</span><br />
Strong arms, and steeled, have not availed to raise it,<br />
And shall a hand more fitting for the dance&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span> Beware of such a sneer. The mountain lily<br />
Would crush the mountain if 'twere bid to do it;<br />
And midst the mighty ruin it had wrought<br />
Itself would smile in safety. This I pledge thee!<br />
The foe shall fly, the land once more be free,<br />
The sceptre to thy line shall be confirmed,<br />
And holy hands at Rheims shall crown thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span>                                       <span style="margin-left: 14em;">Thy bearing</span><br />
Forbids all thought of fraud, and proves that thou<br />
And falsehood have no fellowship: thou art<br />
Thyself deceived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span>             <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I know that I may seem</span><br />
A mere enthusiast, a frail, weak woman:<br />
None think more meanly of me than myself:<br />
But sense of weakness proves me not deceived.<br />
Then scorn me not; if mercy once be spurned,<br />
Indignant Heaven in frowns may hide his face,<br />
And change the dew of blessing to a curse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span> We have declared our will, but even now,<br />
To pass to Dauphin&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span>                <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Fly from the foe!</span><br />
Leave thy inheritance! forfeit thy birthright!<br />
Desert the post consigned to thee! the shepherd<br />
Throw thus aside his crook, mean safety seeking,<br />
And leave the hapless flock the fell wolf's prey!<br />
O! France! poor land! then art thou lost indeed,<br />
Though not by Heaven cast off. Thy prince deserts thee&mdash;<br />
In evil hour betrays himself and thee.<br />
These are my country's tears; and mark me, prince,<br />
Such tears as these shall, in a sea of woe,<br />
In judgment's awful hour, submerge thy soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alen.</span> The prince is moved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cha.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">We'll think upon this matter.</span><br />
Meanwhile thou mayst retire.</p>

A secret presses here, which ere my soul<br />
Can quit in peace its tenement of clay,<br />

A stream of crimson light, when ev'ning's gloom<br />
Enshrouds all else&mdash;in token of respect<br />
To him who sleeps below. Did not the chill<br />
Of age, perhaps of death, benumb my limbs,<br />
My watchful feet, accustomed to the path,<br />
Had led me to the spot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aus.</span> Nought save the wind, which tired of being pent<br />
Within these cloistered aisles, and heavy made<br />
By penitential sighs, doth sullen moan<br />
For liberty, and free access to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abb.</span> 'Tis hushed, whate'er it was. Now listen, Austin:&mdash;<br />
When 'gainst the legions of the Saracen<br />
The hearts of knights with holy ardour burned,<br />
And kings and nobles left their native land,<br />
The young Montalbert, fav'rite of his prince,<br />
Joined those heroic ranks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aus.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Montalbert! he</span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Abb.</span>                      <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Alas! here secretly</span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Aus.</span>                              <span style="margin-left: 10em;">He fell in fight.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abb.</span> Oh! would that it were so. Come nigher, Austin.<br />
That marriage was discovered to the monarch,<br />
And pride, primeval sin of men and angels,<br />
Betrayed the kingly mind, and he&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aus.</span>                              <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Why pause?</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abb.</span> It is a dreadful thing, my son, to drag<br />
Forgotten crime to light, and turn aside<br />
The veil which time hath drawn o'er guilt in pity.<br />
Montalbert secretly was sent to France<br />
On private embassy.&mdash;He sought his bride!<br />
His steps were tracked&mdash;beneath these walls he fell,<br />
Here breathed his parting groan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abb.</span> Beneath this stone his cold remains were laid,<br />
In stately armour clad, as he desired,<br />
That he might lie, as warrior ought to lie,<br />
Prepared at once to start again to life,<br />
When the last trump shall sound. All save his sword,<br />
All in this grave, name, honours, wrongs, revenge,<br />
Were buried deep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aus.</span>              <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Why not his sword?</span></p>

Which darkens life ofttimes unveils futurity;<br />
And simple dying men have proved true prophets.<br />
"This sword," he cried, to our good, weeping father,<br />
"First won from holiest tomb in Palestine,<br />
Hath earnest reaped of glorious deeds to come.<br />
Darkness shall cover France: in that her hour<br />
Of utmost peril, blood of mine shall claim it,<br />
And with it work deliverance. Where it lies<br />
Let none ere know, save those who shall succeed thee."<br />

So shallow found, that urchin foot dare tempt<br />
Its depth, and laughing overleap its banks;<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span> Alas! not yet returned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span>                          <span style="margin-left: 9em;">The way is far.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span> What, if too careful of his charge, the abbot<br />
Coldly deny his suit, some fraud suspecting?<br />
Wouldst know the heaviest ill mortality<br />
Can bear? 'Tis this&mdash;suspense. Suspense dries up<br />
The fertile mind, holds captive ev'ry nerve,<br />
The spirit sinks, impedes swift Time's career,<br />
And stays the golden chariot of the sky;<br />
Clothes noon's resplendent face with heavy clouds,<br />
Makes peaceful night laborious, watchful day.<br />
Ill, and its train of ills, may all be borne;<br />
But dire suspense, that canker of the soul,<br />
Like a fell blight encrusts each energy<br />
Of mind and frame, and with unnatural heat<br />
Consumes the oil of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span>                      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Let's cheat the hours</span><br />
With converse of the past. Sit on this turf,<br />
And here recount the story of thy days.<br />
Sure thou wert deemed, from reason's dawn, a treasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span> E'en from my childhood I was never like<br />
Those whom my childhood shared. To be alone<br />
My joy, thoughts undefined my fancy filling.<br />
Sometimes my heart would throb, my young eye swim<br />
With sudden tears; but why I could not tell.<br />
I seemed, e'en then, cast from some other sphere,<br />
Of which sufficient memory was left<br />
To link me closer to a former state!<br />
And make me feel an exile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Would I'd known thee!</span><br />
How sweet to mark developement of mind<br />
Pregnant as thine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span>              <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Thou might'st have been as others.</span><br />
I was not loved. I was not understood.<br />
Some deemed me void of Nature's kindly gifts,<br />
In intellect deficient, and in heart<br />
Most cold. Oh! how they wronged that heart! I loved<br />
Too keen, alas! yet had but few to love,<br />
And fewer still to answer to my love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> I pain thee now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span>                 <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Regret it not; the heart,</span><br />
Like the swelled ocean, must exceed its bounds,<br />
And find departed calm best in exhaustion.<br />
'Tis past, and I can smile again, dear Bertha.<br />
It was a bitter time, and I, perhaps,<br />
Had been a ruined child, when Heaven first sent<br />
A holy man to shelter in our village.<br />
A warrior he had been, but heavy woes<br />
Had made him change the helmet for the cowl.<br />
In hist'ry's page he deep was skilled. I heard,<br />
And stole beside him. He did not notice me.<br />
Then afterwards he marked my kindling eye,<br />
And soon, amazed, I found myself his favourite.<br />
A new bright world was opened to my view.<br />
He told of ages past, of heroes bold,<br />
Of women too, who, for their country's weal,<br />
Had nobly died. No longer now alone,<br />
I dwelt where mighty spirits dwelt. I heard<br />
Their lofty thoughts, their sentiments sublime,<br />
And lived but in the glorious creation<br />
My fancy had called forth. Had I a sorrow?<br />
'Twas, how mean myself. Had I a hope?<br />
It was that I might emulate their deeds,<br />
And prove as great as them whom thus I honoured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Strange tissue of events, which Heaven delights<br />
Ofttimes to weave, making the link which seems<br />
Meanest to our poor, erring comprehension,<br />
The chief on which the chain of life depends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span> Now could I feel the smart of England's yoke,<br />
And now one burning wish my heart consumed&mdash;<br />
To save my country and my prince. Day-dreams<br />
Or nightly visions had one single theme.<br />
Whole nights I wept, whole nights I prayed. One day,<br />
Upon a gentle slope I stood. Beneath me<br />
Lay the smiling plain in vernal beauty.<br />
Thence I beheld (how swells my heart e'en now!)<br />
A squadron of the foe passing triumphant.<br />
The trumpet's voice I heard, and the loud laugh<br />
Alternate rang in echoes through the woods.<br />
I gazed; a madd'ning fire, a deadly chill<br />
Seized on my frame. I fled the sound, nor paused<br />
Till at the altar's foot I threw myself,<br />
In agony and spent. Words issued not&mdash;<br />
I raised my supplicating hands on high:<br />
Then sank into a trance, as since I find.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Scarce have I drawn my breath, lest one brief word<br />
Should 'scape my ear; and now I gaze on thee<br />
Almost with awe, temp'ring my fond affection.<br />
What followed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan.</span>          <span style="margin-left: 3em;">As I lay soft music fell</span><br />
Upon my ear, diffusing calm ineffable,<br />
When thus a voice pronounc'd&mdash;"Go, raise the siege<br />
Of Orleans." I awoke. The organ's swell<br />
Filled aisle and vault, and choral voices sang<br />
The hymn of praise; but I could hear alone<br />
The voice which still was thrilling on my ear,<br />
And in a burst of joy I joined the chaunt.<br />
Then forth I rushed to execute my mission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> And that resplendent vision shall not fail&mdash;<br />
Thy simple name brightest shall stand upon<br />
The roll of time&mdash;the glory of thy sex&mdash;<br />
The wonder of thy age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du N.</span> I have no kin. What owe I to their love<br />
That I should claim them such? The life I have?<br />
The debt is cancelled by the shame entailed.<br />
To me my country is both sire and mother;<br />
And I for her such gallant deeds will work,<br />
That should I ever boast the name of father,<br />
My children shall exult in their descent,<br />
And swear by France, by honour, and their sire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John T.</span> Are not their arms against their country turned<br />
In aid of foreign foes? Are they not traitors;<br />
Aye, traitors to the land they help to fetter?<br />
These fields may haply drink my heart's life-blood;<br />
But as I hope for glory, ere I die,<br />
(The winding sheet I crave,) I would prefer<br />
To clasp in friendliness the hand which slew me<br />
In brave defence of its own rights and laws;<br />
Than the false caitiff's, fighting by my side,<br />
Those rights, those laws to crush beneath our feet.</p>

Yet there is something here that pleads for him.<br />
His mother's hatred drives him from a throne,<br />
Whilst my fond mother's parting kiss still glows<br />
Upon my brow; and when I heard what tears<br />
He shed, when told his father was no more,<br />
I mingled mine with his; and his bereavement<br />
Making my own, I honoured him for all<br />
The grief he show'd, and felt him nobler foe.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Valancour.</span> <span class="smcap">Arnault.</span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Arn.</span> Sayst thou the siege is raised?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>                                 <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Orleans is free.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span> And she, the sainted maid, has done the deed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span> Herself! the maid of Orleans henceforth named.<br />
Oh! 'twas a noble sight to see her entrance<br />
Into the city she herself had saved.<br />
Each distant quarter had disgorged itself<br />
Of its inhabitants. Age had forgotten<br />
All its decrepitude; sickness, its pains.<br />
Walls, windows, streets, each edifice and pillar<br />
Seemed as a living mass; and waving hands<br />
And loud acclaims filled the astonished air.<br />
The sun burst forth in joy. Onward she came,<br />
Our civil functionaries at her head,<br />
The wonderous sword and standard borne before her.<br />
The princely Duke Alen&ccedil;on at her side,<br />
His stately countenance impressed alike<br />
With patriotic joy and martial pride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span> And thou wert in the fight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>                             <span style="margin-left: 12em;">I was, and near her;</span><br />
A proud distinction, for where'er she stood<br />
There hottest battle raged: the foe to crush her,<br />
Friends to rival her. Sight alone of her<br />
Gave spirit to the faint, and kindled courage<br />
E'en to its height. Herself in ev'ry part,<br />
Like lightning's bolt was seen, sudden as fatal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span> The night was terrible. The heavens appeared<br />
To threaten earth with wreck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>                          <span style="margin-left: 8em;">It has no fellow.</span><br />
Terrific thunders rattled through the sky,<br />
And fiery vengeance hissed upon the ground,<br />
With human gore and heavy rain deep drenched.<br />
"See! Heaven itself doth fight for us!" she cried.<br />
As struck with terror back our troops recoiled.<br />
The happy augury was hailed with shouts,<br />
And victory was ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span>                  <span style="margin-left: 5em;">But yet, methinks,</span><br />
The hand of woman should be free from stain,<br />
And most from stain of blood: the lamb for innocence,<br />
The kite for prey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>               <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">No blood has stained her hand.</span><br />
The sword she bears nor forms defence, nor wounds,<br />
But guides the fight. Amidst its loudest din<br />
And fiercest rage she shows a countenance<br />
Most calmly brave, most femininely gentle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span> And he, great Orleans' valiant son, was he&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span> Ah! 'twas a curious sight to see how proud<br />
He scorned the maid when first she reached the camp.<br />
His great heart swelled against her, and his gibe,<br />
Keen as his sword, betrayed contempt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span>                                  <span style="margin-left: 12em;">And well</span><br />
He might be pardoned, if he deemed the thought<br />
Injurious, that a woman should succeed<br />
Where he himself had failed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>                         <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Forth armed she went,</span><br />
A graceful female, though in martial garb.<br />
He marked her lack of sword and loosed his own;<br />
And with a curled lip and mock humility<br />
He turned the heft, and offered it in silence.<br />
"I may not trust to arms," she calmly said.<br />
His searching eye glanced on her countenance,<br />
He coloured crimson deep, and the proud sneer<br />
Forsook his lip, and, like a lion tamed,<br />
He showed him gentlest where he least intended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span> He must beware: the stream turned suddenly<br />
May suddenly become a torrent. Love,<br />
From hatred sprung, can only be excelled<br />
By hatred born from love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>)           <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Why should the thought</span><br />
Dart agony like this into my heart?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span> What next is her intent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>                          <span style="margin-left: 9em;">To pass to Rheims.</span><br />
Thither, at dawn, the prince departs to join her,<br />
And the army she conducts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arn.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Heaven speed the journey.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span> How swift a courier is this winged love!<br />
Why I have made this journey in less time,<br />
Impelled by thought of her, than ere before,<br />
Though martial glory spurred me on the way,<br />
And every proud ambitious hope to boot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span> Our jaded horses prove that truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>                                    <span style="margin-left: 12em;">And yet</span><br />
They sped not swift enough for my fond wishes.<br />
Say, hast thou ever marked the moon's full beams<br />
Upon the wave, when broken by the breeze?<br />
Such is the image of my heart: joy's rays<br />
Illume its depths and sparkle on its surface;<br />
But all within is restless&mdash;bright confusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span> Well may she wake such love, such fond impatience;<br />
Not breath of closing flowers, not eve's soft beam&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span> With nought that marks decline compare my Alice.<br />
She is the blush of morn first caught by earth,<br />
When seraph hands unbar the gates of heaven,<br />
And from its courts bright beams of glory stream.<br />
Fresh as the od'rous breath by zephyr scattered,<br />
When first from dewy flowers he springs rejoicing;<br />
Light as the froth by chafed ocean cast,<br />
When young Aurora, laughing at his suit,<br />
Refuses to retard her rosy steps;<br />
And playful as the changeful hues reflected<br />
Upon its quivering breast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 7em;">She comes.&mdash;Farewell.</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Countess.</span>                 <span style="margin-left: 4em;">My life, my Warwick!</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span> My own! thus let me clasp thee to my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span> No! let me see thou art indeed my Lord,<br />
And read in those dear eyes the joy of mine.<br />
Thou hast been long in coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>                           <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Sweetest, no.</span><br />
Impatient, like myself, thou hast, I see,<br />
Been measuring the hours by love's slow glass,<br />
And made them sad and heavy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Now thou'rt wrong&mdash;</span><br />
Not sad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>     Not sad when Warwick is away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span> Have I not hope to share the hours with me?<br />
And who can e'er be sad in such sweet fellowship?<br />
Thy last receding step dries up my tears,<br />
For thus she gently whispers to my heart&mdash;<br />
"The moment passed that bore him from thy view,<br />
The next but draws him nearer to thy arms."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span> But how deceive the intervening moments?<br />
Art thou not lonesome oft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span>                     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">How may that be?</span><br />
From thee I never am divided. Thought<br />
Personates thyself, and thus I talk with thee,<br />
Sit by thy side, frame answers for thyself<br />
So full of love, so paint thy face with smiles,<br />
Thy eyes with such approval fill, my heart<br />
Leaps with delight: then only am I lone<br />
When some intruder comes intent to cheer me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span> Why thus thou'lt make me jealous of myself,<br />
And envious of the shadow I supply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span> Then too I sing to thee, or deck myself,<br />
And try which ornament doth suit me best:<br />
Smile at the smiling image I behold,<br />
And bid the vivid blush, which spreads my cheek,<br />
Fade not away, that it may tell my Warwick<br />
'Twas thought of him which makes me value beauty,<br />
And prize the charms that justifies his choice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span> Sweet flatterer! Then thou art happy, Alice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span> Indeed I do not know what means unhappiness.<br />
E'en from my infancy I have been blessed.<br />
My eyes first opened on the laughing spring,<br />
And all of life, of hope, of fond affection<br />
Has been passed in springtide. I never shed<br />
A tear till my great father died; and those<br />
First tears were wiped away by him whom first<br />
I loved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>     But how! thou dost not even ask<br />
If Salisbury's sad death has been avenged!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span> Contains revenge then ought that may impart<br />
Joy to felicity, or make repose<br />
More tranquil, which already was complete,<br />
That it should be desired?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Nor yet enquire</span><br />
How speeds the war?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span>              <span style="margin-left: 4em;">I love not war.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>                                <span style="margin-left: 10em;">And yet</span><br />
Art Salisbury's child, art&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span>                      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Warwick's bride, thou'dst say.</span><br />
Of him whose gallant heart of war makes pastime,<br />
And who a rival gives me in renown.<br />
And yet I do repeat, I love not war,<br />
And rather in our native woods would stray,<br />
Listening the thrush's early note of love,<br />
Or plucking wild flowers from the bank to crown thee,<br />
Than hail thee, Warwick, conqueror of France.<br />
Ha! there is blood upon thy arm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>                             <span style="margin-left: 9em;">For shame!</span><br />
Turn pale&mdash;a very coward thou.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span>                         <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Not I:</span><br />
But nature is to blame, who doth abhor<br />
The sight of blood: but if I must, as fits<br />
A soldier's wife, enquire of war, then tell me,<br />
Not how many thousands perished, but what<br />
New honours thou hast gained; and better still,<br />
Say, how much nearer is the end of strife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span> My honours gained is not to feel disgraced.<br />
A strange reverse has visited our arms.<br />
Not alone has Orleans been relieved,<br />
And other strong posts fall'n, but at the name<br />
Of Joan of Arc our stoutest cheeks turn pale.<br />
Myself beheld the maid, banner in hand,<br />
March by our troops, with Suffolk at their head,<br />
Not only unmolested, but with dread,&mdash;<br />
Such awe hath filled all hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span>                           <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Tell me no more.</span><br />
Unbend that brow, and think alone of me,<br />
And in these smiles forget&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Aye! all forget</span><br />
But this&mdash;that thou art mine&mdash;my own for ever.<br />
Forget that with the dawn I must depart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span> Oh, no! thou must not go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War.</span>                             <span style="margin-left: 11em;">I dare not tarry.</span><br />
Exasperated by our late reverse,<br />
And fearing that success to bolder deeds<br />
May tempt the foe, the regent hath desired<br />
Lord Scales and Talbot to unite with us&mdash;<br />
We wait at Patay for their promised force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count.</span> No more. Now let love's rosy fingers<br />
Press the swift foot of time and stay his flight.</p>

E'en through the heart of Bedford's army!<br />
What rashness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>           <span style="margin-left: 3em;">'Tis by order of the maid.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riche.</span> What folly next, is son as father mad?<br />
Thou canst not mean it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>                    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">'Tis fact, my lord.</span><br />
She must behold the crown plac'd on his head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riche.</span> Eternal curses light upon her own.<br />
Thwarted in all my views, fortune but mocks,<br />
Instead of crowning me. These rival states<br />
Should from my fiat take their destiny.<br />
Nor care I whether Charles or Bedford win,<br />
So either make a step for my ascent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span> Yet both have slighted&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riche.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Me!&mdash;'tis false as hell.</span><br />
They may appear to show me some neglect,<br />
And why? Both fear me, both are jealous of me.<br />
What else could instigate the wary Bedford<br />
To waive my offer to command his host?<br />
What too but envy influences Charles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span> The dauphin's heart is warm&mdash;he may feel sore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riche.</span> At what? That I should cause his myrmidons<br />
To shed their forfeit blood! his fav'rites banish?<br />
Yet little have I gained&mdash;his present minion<br />
Provokes my stronger hate, and worse contempt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span> But you will grace the f&ecirc;te with your high presence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riche.</span> No: let them play the part of fools without me.<br />
His majesty of Bourges doth well to merge<br />
His title, erst bestowed on him, for one<br />
Still more absurd in folly.</p>

My own name tarnished by severe defeat<br />
On Beuvron's plains, my promises proved empty,<br />
While hers, though most extravagant, fulfilled,<br />
The fools will honour her, o'erlook myself;<br />
Or worse, most odious contrast may be made<br />
Betwixt successful rashness on her part,<br />
And baffled skill on mine. Not Heaven itself<br />
Shall force me to such chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Val.</span>                           <span style="margin-left: 8em;">If fortune's tide</span><br />
Have met a turn, no matter by what means,<br />
Would it be well to stand aloof, and miss<br />
The way to honour? Will not thy absence<br />
Rather awake impertinent remark,&mdash;<br />
Be deemed his will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riche.</span>              <span style="margin-left: 4em;">There's reason in thy words;</span><br />
And more, so prodigal is he, so reckless,<br />
New honours he may heap on her, and plead<br />
Omission on my part as his excuse.<br />
I'll spare him that pretence.&mdash;Prepare for Baugenci.</p>

In the full sweet tones of her impressive voice,<br />
Which heard but once, dwells long upon the ear,<br />
Charmed with the sound; then sinks into the heart,<br />
No more to be forgotten, pleading still<br />
When she herself is mute. How goes the hour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> Day's harbinger, with chilly lips, has kissed<br />

For the first time I dread to-morrow's chance.<br />
The attempt is bold, and skilfully conceived,<br />
On Suffolk's ranks to fall, and break his force<br />
Ere Talbot can arrive and strength unite;<br />
But if the project fail!&mdash;(<i>Aside,</i>) I cannot think<br />

Who fears defeat in what the maid devises?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du N.</span> Heaven doth not always smile on those he loves.<br />
Time offers marvels: once the name of Joan<br />
I scorned, abhorred! I do not hate it now,<br />
Though now I've cause. She robs me of renown,<br />
And at her bidding I unsheath my sword.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> She may be proud!&mdash;a victory she has won,<br />
That spirit to subdue. She hath in truth<br />
A charm to make stern hearts most meek, and yet<br />
She is not beautiful, as men count beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du N.</span> She is the better suited to my taste;<br />
I do despise the doll, where nought of soul<br />
Is ever seen to light the faultless eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> Yet glances have been cast on thee<br />
Which might have thawed the coldest heart, and caused<br />
An angry lance to tremble in its rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du N.</span> Hers is that beauty by the mind conferred,<br />
The outward vestment lumined by the soul,<br />
Which sets respect as centinel to guard<br />
The treasure stored within, and from approach<br />
Too near, restrains those whisperers of nought,<br />
Who throng impertinent around the form,<br />
Which owes to symmetry alone, and feature,<br />
Its power to fascinate. There is a dignity<br />
Withal in her simplicity, which awes<br />
The surer for the company unwont<br />
In which 'tis found. Nature herein has mocked<br />
The cunning artist's skill, who, in a rim<br />
Of purest silver sets his goodliest stone,<br />
Making the metal richer for the gem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span> Thou lovest her then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du N.</span>                        <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Are words denied the heart</span><br />
Of firmest mould, or what enchains my tongue?<br />
If life for life, if soul for soul exchanged,<br />
So honour were retained, be mark of love,<br />
Then love I her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xaint.</span>           <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou surely wilt not wed her,</span><br />
When easier terms&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du N.</span>              <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Now, by my sword's good point,</span><br />
For that foul thought I could a vengeance take<br />
Which should forbid all chance of like offence.<br />
Ah! witness not these swelling veins, that I<br />
Myself am heir of wanton shame, and worse,<br />
Of broken faith? Sits not the stamp accursed<br />
Of bastardy upon my brow, to dim<br />
The gems that in my coronet might sparkle?<br />
And shall I imitate the vice I scorn,<br />
And wring some breast with anguish like my own?<br />
Hear me, ye mighty Pow'rs above, if e'er,<br />
Through me, should fall the tear of broken virtue;<br />
If cry of babe that may not bear my name,<br />

A mighty impulse not to be controlled.<br />
Impute not then to arrogance, or worse,<br />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arlington.</span> <span class="smcap">Officer.</span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Off.</span> Here let us rest till morning. Like ourselves,<br />
The foe are glad to seek that needful rest<br />
Which victory and defeat alike demand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span> No, let us on. We yet may find it hard<br />
To reach our friends, and Richemont hovers near us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Off.</span> Whate'er the peril, here I swear to rest me.<br />
See! the bright moon looks down upon the field,<br />
As if in scorn to view such waste of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span> It is a ghastly sight. Not drops of heaven<br />
Bedew the earth, but blood of men; and blood<br />
Has dyed the stream so deep, that thirsty lip<br />
Of death rejects the draught it craved so wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Off.</span> Wide is the difference 'twixt the gallant scene<br />
Ere fight begins, and that which marks its close:<br />
Bright shields and dancing plumes, and brighter eyes,<br />
And animating speech abrupt, and tramp<br />
Of martial steed, and neigh, impatient sent,<br />
And spirit-stirring trumpet, and the drum;<br />
The banner waving wide, and heavy sound<br />
Of mighty engines breathing fire, showed life<br />
This morn in brightest mood and proudest pomp;<br />
Now Death sits centinel in horrid silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span> Our loss is great, and will be greater still<br />
If we continue this unhallowed war:<br />
Many brave men this day have breathed their last:&mdash;<br />
Most I regret young Talbot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Off.</span>                        <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Is he dead?</span><br />
I saw brave Warwick rushing to his rescue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span> He came too late. From heaps of slain he snatched him,<br />
Then bore him to a distance, yet alive;<br />
But dews of death were gathering on his brow,<br />
And his dim eye betrayed departure near.<br />
He dared not turn him on his side, lest life<br />
From that deep welling wound should 'scape too fast.<br />
He watched the sun go down, and darker shades<br />
O'erspread his face. Impatient now become,<br />
Often he murmured to himself and said,<br />
"It is too late; he will not come, and I<br />
Must die at last without my father's blessing."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Off.</span> Many brave hearts will mourn for him: he was<br />
A noble scion of a noble stem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span> We thought that he was gone, when the quick step<br />
Of his despairing father sounded near.<br />
Stern death relaxed his hold, and for short space<br />
Allowed his spirit to reanimate<br />
His chilly frame. He raised him on his side,<br />
Clung round his father's neck, and looking on him,<br />
Feebly he said, "Have I done well, my father?<br />
Am I John Talbot's son?" "Too well! too well!<br />
My brave"&mdash;was all the father could reply;<br />
But 'twas enough&mdash;the young man caught the sound.<br />
And dropping back his head, he smiled and died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Off.</span> And his brave sire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arl.</span>                     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">As if transfixed, he gazed,</span><br />
And mute&mdash;then by the body of his son<br />
He threw him down, kissed his cold lips, and oft,<br />
Midst sobs, he cried, "And art thou gone so soon?<br />
Thy morning ended ere thy noon begun;<br />
And such a noon!" but sudden on his hands<br />
He saw the crimson stain of that dear blood,<br />
And like a lion maddened at the sight,<br />
His grief was checked, and springing on his feet<br />
He seized his massy sword, and wildly rushed<br />
Into the fight.</p>

And my poor heart would cease to throb, my head<br />
To burn. One,&mdash;three are gone, and now the last.<br />
I have no more to lose!<br />
I'll lay him in the bed these hands have dug,<br />
(I've kiss'd his eyes to sleep,) and then I'll seek<br />
The spirits of my lord and other boys,<br />
And bring them here to see, how, e'en in poverty,<br />

The flavour surely should have charmed your palate;<br />

Yon was my son: time was when I had four;<br />

Do maniacs know what wakes their frenzy?<br />
Why then is madness cursed, accursed doubly.<br />
Saw ye his wounds? gaped they not wide? didst mark?<br />
I would have washed them in the stream hard by,<br />
Had it not crimson flowed, and the foul taint<br />
Of many a blackened corpse corrupted it.<br />
What could I do? I washed them in the wine<br />
I had reserved to cheer his bridal day.<br />
I never, never thought ye would have pledged him<br />
On his cold bier. Now from my sight be gone,<br />
Lest haply I should wither you with curses<br />
Before the time.      <span class="aralign">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>.</span><br />

I'll hang upon his steps, and breathe my vengeance<br />

The blood with force accelerated speeds,<br />
And dyes with crimson blush the pallid skin.</p>

<span class="smcap">Count.</span> Behold this scroll: here read what you would know.<br />
Haste! haste! from Warwick I have stol'n unseen,<br />
And trait'rous been to him whom most I love,<br />
In love's own cause.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Du N.</span>                <span style="margin-left: 4em;">And thou, for this disloyalty,</span><br />
Shall be absolved&mdash;this pure and holy act<br />
Shall win approval e'en from Heaven itself,<br />
And plead for thee when other deeds may fail thee.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Count.</span> Blame not my Warwick for his stern resolve:&mdash;<br />
Firm as he is, he has a tender heart.<br />
Had not his face been buried in his arm,<br />

Escaped him unperceived.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Joan.</span> Delude me not with erring thought of bliss,<br />
Nor yet deceive thyself&mdash;ere morrow's dawn<br />
The dews will bathe the spot where earthly suff'ring<br />
Hath found an end. No hand, though brave as thine,<br />
Can pluck me from it.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Du N.</span>                 <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Never has it failed me,</span><br />
Nor shall it fail me now&mdash;nay, doubt me not;<br />
I swore to lay thee in a grave that's free&mdash;<br />
Rouen is cursed by the usurper's foot,<br />
And here thou shalt not die, so hear me Heaven!&mdash;<br />
But not another moment may I linger.<br />

<p>
<span class="smcap">Count.</span>                <span style="margin-left: 3em;">May I not speak to thee?</span><br />
I would not give thee pain, no, not in thought.<br />
I knew thee brave, so brave I feared thy name,<br />
And never had I dared to venture near thee;<br />
But now to see thee thus, so sweet, so gentle,<br />
I feel as if some silver chord had linked<br />
Our hearts together, and would claim thee sister.<br />
And thou canst weep!</p>

<span class="smcap">Joan.</span>                <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Tears are woman's birthright,</span><br />
Starting to her relief in joy or sorrow.<br />

<p>
<span class="smcap">Joan.</span> It is in vain, and the swift moments fly.<br />
Lady, leave me. I must be calm in death,<br />
Lest nature's weakness make my foes to triumph.<br />
The blessing of a spirit thou hast soothed<br />
Gild thy bright path and cheer thy parting hour.<br />
Farewell, for ever.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Count.</span>              <span style="margin-left: 2em;">No; Du Nois, Warwick,</span><br />

My hour is come, and I content to die.<br />
It was a trying hour; for hard it is<br />
To measure back our steps to life, when we<br />
Have almost knocked at death's grim portals.<br />
One tear for thee, Du Nois, the last I shed.<br />
One prayer for thee, my country and my king.<br />
My king! a princely diadem is his,<br />
And mine this murky dungeon and these chains:<br />
Yet have I placed him there&mdash;and mine<br />
The hand that stemmed his fortune's tide, and broke<br />
The fetters that enslaved the land.<br />
Enough. The bitterness of death, is past.<br />
That thought has robbed the flames of all their terrors.<br />
Farewell to earth! farewell to earthly ties!<br />
When next I think of him, of thee, my country,<br />
Then will eternity have set its impress<br />
Upon remembrance.</p>

Midst dangers calm, when stoutest bosoms shook.<br />
Hast often seen, how in such fearful times,<br />
She would upraise her speaking eyes to heaven,<br />
And stand in silence, while her countenance<br />
Reflected beams she thence appeared to catch;<br />
Such was her bearing then. Her step was firm,<br />
Yet modest, as might properly become<br />
One, who in presence of her mighty Judge<br />
Must quickly stand. Nor had her wonted smile<br />
Forsook her lip, but lingered, loath to part,<br />
Its former sweetness mixed with heavenly hope.<br />
Nor scowling eye, (for savage looks were there,)<br />
Nor piercing gaze, nor pity's tender glance,<br />
Nor urgent priest's dire threats to fright or force<br />
Confession from her lips, she heeded once:<br />
Save when to the accursed pile fast bound,<br />
He pointed to the smoking heap around her,<br />
And bade her timely think what hotter flames<br />
Awaited one who had been leagued with devils.<br />
Then passed a sudden flash o'er her pale cheek,<br />
And in those tones so often proved resistless,<br />
"Blessed," she said, "is he who hath reserved<br />
All judgment to himself. May thy injustice<br />
Be forgotten when thou most needest mercy."<br />
A hideous shout was raised&mdash;my blood with horror&mdash;</p>

The groan of thousands ringing in my ear,<br />
In dread of what to thee&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du N.</span>                     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">And she is gone,</span><br />
In ignorance of all I felt for her,<br />
Or could have done! And nought remains of her<br />
That I might see how lovely even death<br />
Can show himself, when to the lovely joined;<br />
Might cheat my soul awhile she did but sleep,<br />
And seal a last, first kiss upon her brow!<br />
Earth not a particle now holds of her,<br />
O'er which these stranger drops might fall!</p>

Can this be so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du N.</span>           <span style="margin-left: 2em;">I do not hide my face</span><br />
Ashamed thou shouldst behold Du Nois can weep;<br />
Or show how grief can bend e'en his stern spirit:<br />
But when in after days you speak of this,<br />
And I perchance have found a bloody grave,<br />
Say, nought in life he dared, so awful seemed,<br />
As sight of agony which wrung his heart,<br />
And sank the soldier in the man.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
